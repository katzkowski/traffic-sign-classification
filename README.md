# Traffic Sign Classification with Neural Networks

The aim of this project is to implement and train several neural networks in PyTorch for the task of traffic sign classification. The dataset used is from the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) (reference below). Results and a more detailed description will be published in the future as this project is still WIP.

## Architectures
Below is a list that tracks which of the planned architectures have already been implemented and trained. See `networks.py` for the implementation. 

- [x] Single linear layer
- [x] Fully-connected network: 2 fully-connected layers
- [x] Convolutional network: 2 convolutional layers with max pooling, 2 fully-connected layers
- [ ] Convolutional network with residual connections
- [ ] (Variational) Autoencoder
